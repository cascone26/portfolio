### Post 1 — Introduction

Hey KC — I'm Jacob Cascone, and I just launched my freelance web and AI services business here in the metro.

Quick version of what I do:
- Build simple, clean websites for small businesses ($500–800)
- Set up Google Business Profiles so you show up in local searches ($150)
- Add AI chatbots that answer customer questions 24/7 ($400–700)
- Automate follow-up emails so you never lose a lead again ($300–500)

I've spent years working with web tech and AI tools, and I'm now putting that to work for local businesses right here in Kansas City.

If you own a local business and you're tired of your website looking like it was built in 2012 — or you don't have one at all — let's talk.

### Post 2 — Free Audit Offer

Honest question: when did you last look at your business website on a phone?

Most small business websites have at least 3 of these problems:
- Loads too slowly
- Looks broken on mobile
- Contact info is hard to find
- No clear call to action
- Not showing up on Google

I'm offering free website audits this month for Kansas City businesses. I'll look at your site and give you a straightforward list of what's hurting you — no sales pitch, no obligation.

If you want one, just comment "AUDIT" or message me your website URL. I'll get back to you within 24 hours.

(If you don't have a website yet, I can audit your Google Business Profile or social media presence instead.)

---

### Post 3 — Local Business Tip

Free tip for any Kansas City business that wants more customers from Google:

Fill out your Google Business Profile completely.

That means:
- Business hours (including holidays)
- 10+ photos (interior, exterior, products, team)
- A real description with your city name and what you do
- Responses to every review, good and bad

Most businesses do maybe 30% of this. The ones that do 100% show up first.

It's free. It takes an afternoon. And it's one of the highest-ROI things a local business can do.

If you want help setting it up right, I charge $150 and handle the whole thing. Message me.

---

### Post 4 — AI Explanation for Non-Tech People

"AI" sounds complicated. Here's what it actually looks like for a small business:

Imagine a customer lands on your website at 9pm on a Saturday. They have a question about your hours, pricing, or availability. Normally, they'd leave and call someone else.

With an AI chatbot on your site, they get an answer instantly. The chatbot collects their info and sends you a notification. Monday morning, you follow up with a warm lead instead of a missed opportunity.

That's it. That's AI for small business.

It's not robots. It's not sci-fi. It's a tool that works while you sleep.

I build and set these up for local businesses starting at $400. If you're curious how it would work for your specific business, message me — I'm happy to explain it in plain English.

---

### Post 5 — Trust Builder / Social Proof

What I believe about working with small businesses:

You shouldn't need a $5,000 retainer to get a professional website. You shouldn't have to chase an agency for updates. And you shouldn't have to understand code to know if you're getting what you paid for.

That's why I work directly with clients, explain everything in plain English, and keep my prices fair for real small businesses — not venture-funded startups.

50% upfront. 50% when you're happy with the result. Two rounds of revisions included. You own everything when we're done.

If that sounds like the kind of person you'd want to work with, I'd love to connect.

## Neighbor Intro Post

**Title:** Neighbor offering free website help — no catch

Hey neighbors — I'm Jacob, I live in [your neighborhood name] and I wanted to introduce myself in a useful way.

I do web development and tech consulting for small businesses, and I've noticed a lot of great local businesses around KC have websites that either don't exist, haven't been updated since the Obama administration, or just don't show up when you search for them.

I'm not posting to advertise — I just figure if I can actually help someone nearby, that's better than sending a flyer.

If you own a local business (or know someone who does) and you're wondering whether your website or Google listing is hurting you, I'm happy to take a look for free and give you honest feedback. No obligation, no sales call, just a neighbor helping out.

Feel free to DM me here. Happy to help.

— Jacob

## 3 Follow-Up Nextdoor Posts

### Week 2 Follow-Up

Wanted to share something I've seen a lot lately since I do web work locally:

If your business has a Google Business Profile but you haven't posted to it or responded to reviews in the last 6 months, Google quietly ranks you lower in search results.

It treats inactivity as a signal that you might be closed or not worth recommending.

Takes about 15 minutes to fix — add a photo, respond to your last few reviews, post a quick update. That's it.

If anyone wants help doing this or wants me to just do it for them, let me know. Happy to walk you through it.

— Jacob (your neighbor in [neighborhood])

---

### Week 3 Follow-Up

Quick neighbor-to-neighbor tip before the weekend:

If you're ever looking for a local business and Google gives you a result that says "Website" — click it, then immediately check if the site works on your phone.

You'd be surprised how many small businesses have websites that look completely broken on mobile. That's the owner losing customers every single day and probably not knowing it.

If that's your business, it's usually a pretty quick fix. Just wanted to put it out there in case it helps anyone.

Feel free to message me if you have questions.

---

### Week 4 Follow-Up

Sharing a win from this week in case it's useful for anyone here:

Helped a local service business get their Google Business Profile fully set up — added photos, filled in all their info, and set up the Q&A section. Within two weeks they started getting calls from people who said they found them on Google Maps.

They'd been operating for three years without that profile being complete. Three years of invisible.

If you have a business and you're not sure whether your Google listing is set up right, I'm still offering free audits for neighbors. Just DM me.

---

## About / Summary Section

*(300 words max, first-person)*

I build websites and set up AI tools for small businesses in the Kansas City area — and I keep it simple, affordable, and actually useful.

My background is in web development and AI integration. Over the years I've worked with everything from basic business sites to AI-powered chatbots and automated follow-up systems. What I've learned is that most small businesses don't need a $10,000 agency engagement — they need someone who speaks plain English, does solid work, and shows up when they say they will.

That's what I offer.

Here's what I typically help with:

- New business websites: clean, fast, mobile-friendly, built to convert visitors into calls or bookings ($500–800)
- Website refreshes for businesses that have a site but it hasn't been touched in years ($150–400)
- Google Business Profile setup and optimization, so you actually show up in local search ($150)
- AI chatbots for business websites that answer questions, collect lead info, and work 24/7 ($400–700)
- Automated email follow-up sequences so you stop losing leads who never heard back ($300–500)
- Monthly tech retainers for businesses that want ongoing support without hiring someone full-time ($150–250/month)

I work directly with every client. No handoffs, no account managers, no surprises.

If you're a small business owner in KC who's been putting off the website refresh or the Google setup because it feels like a hassle — I make it easy. If you're a fellow freelancer or agency looking for a reliable collaborator on web or AI work — I'm open to that too.

Based in Kansas City. Available for local and remote projects.

## 3 LinkedIn Posts

### LinkedIn Post 1 — Value Post (Google Business)

Most local businesses are invisible on Google and don't know it.

Here's a quick audit you can do right now:

1. Google your own business name
2. Does a Knowledge Panel show up on the right side?
3. Is your address, phone, and hours correct?
4. Do you have at least 10 photos?
5. Have you responded to your most recent reviews?

If you said no to more than two of those, Google is not sending you as much traffic as it could be.

The fix isn't complicated or expensive. It's just a matter of knowing what to do and taking the time to do it.

Happy to walk anyone through it. Drop a question in the comments or send me a message.

---

### LinkedIn Post 2 — Story Post

When I tell small business owners I add AI to their websites, I get one of two reactions:

1. "That sounds expensive and complicated."
2. "Wait, can it actually do that?"

The second reaction always happens after I explain it.

An AI chatbot on a business website does one thing really well: it catches the people who would have left without ever contacting you.

Someone visits at 10pm. They have a question. You're closed. Normally they leave. With an AI chatbot, they get an answer, you get their contact info, and you follow up in the morning.

For a plumber, a contractor, a salon, a law office — that's a real lead that would have been lost.

The setup takes a few hours. The cost is $400–700. The chatbot works every night after that.

It's not magic. It's just a better system.

---

### LinkedIn Post 3 — Positioning / Value-Forward

Something I tell every client before we start working together:

A website is not a business goal. It's a tool.

The goal is more customers, more calls, more bookings — or better credibility when someone Googles you. The website is just how you get there.

That framing changes how I build. I'm not trying to make something pretty for the sake of it. I'm asking: what does this person need to see or feel to take action?

For most small businesses, that means:
- Fast load time
- Clear explanation of what you do and where you do it
- Easy way to contact you
- A reason to trust you (reviews, photos, a real human voice in the copy)

That's it. That's the whole formula.

If your current site doesn't do those four things, that's where I'd start.

# SECTION 4: COLD OUTREACH TEMPLATES

---

### Template 1 — Cold DM: Bad or Outdated Website

**Subject/Opener:** Quick note about your website

Hey [Name] — I came across [Business Name] while looking at [local category, e.g., KC electricians / Overland Park restaurants] and wanted to reach out.

Your website caught my attention — but not in the best way. [Specific observation: e.g., "It looks like it hasn't been updated in a while" / "It's not loading well on mobile" / "It's hard to find your phone number"].

I'm a freelance web developer based in Kansas City. I help local businesses clean up their online presence so they don't lose customers before they even make contact.

I can usually fix the core issues for $150–400, or build something fresh for $500–800 if that makes more sense.

Would it be worth a 15-minute call to see if I can help? No pressure either way.

— Jacob Cascone
[email] | [Calendly link]

---

### Template 2 — Cold DM: No Google Business Profile

Hey [Name] — quick heads-up from one person who cares about local business to another:

I searched for [Business Name] on Google Maps and couldn't find you. That means anyone in Kansas City searching for [what they do] in your area is finding your competitors instead.

A properly set up Google Business Profile is free and usually adds real, measurable walk-ins and calls within a few weeks.

I set these up for local businesses for $150 — I handle everything, including photos guidance, category optimization, and the description. Takes about a week to fully populate.

If you want me to do a quick audit and show you exactly what you're missing, I'm happy to do that for free first.

Just reply here or email me: [email]

— Jacob

---

### Template 3 — Cold DM: Restaurant Owner

Hey [Name] — I eat at a lot of KC restaurants and I always check the website or Google listing first to see the menu and hours. I tried to look up [Restaurant Name] and ran into [specific issue: e.g., "the menu wasn't there" / "the hours were wrong" / "the site didn't load on my phone"].

I know running a restaurant doesn't leave a lot of time for tech stuff — that's exactly why I do this work.

I help restaurant owners get their online presence in order: website, Google listing, menu updates. Most restaurant projects are $300–600 depending on what's needed.

Worth a quick call? I promise I'll be brief. You can book 15 minutes here: [Calendly link]

— Jacob Cascone, KC-area web developer

---

### Template 4 — Cold DM: Service Business (Plumber, Electrician, etc.)

Hey [Name] — I found [Business Name] while doing some research on [KC plumbers / local electricians / etc.] and wanted to reach out directly.

I noticed [specific observation — e.g., "your website looks like it might be a few years old" / "you don't have any reviews showing on Google" / "I couldn't find your service area listed anywhere"].

For a service business, your online presence is basically your first impression for every new customer. If it's not working right, you're losing jobs to competitors before you even get a chance to bid.

I help service businesses like yours with:
- Website refresh or new build ($150–800)
- Google Business Profile setup ($150)
- AI chatbot that answers after-hours inquiries ($400–700)

Would you be open to a free 15-minute call? I can tell you quickly if I can help and what it would cost.

— Jacob Cascone
[email] | [Calendly link]

### Template 5 — Cold Email: Local Business

**Subject line options (use one):**
- Quick question about [Business Name]'s website
- Found an issue with your Google listing
- [Business Name] — free website audit offer
- Your website on mobile (quick note)

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

My name is Jacob Cascone. I'm a freelance web developer based in the Kansas City area, and I came across [Business Name] while researching local [category] businesses.

I wanted to reach out because [specific observation — e.g., "your website appears to have some mobile display issues" / "I couldn't locate your Google Business Profile" / "your site took over 8 seconds to load on my phone"].

These aren't unusual problems — most small business websites have at least two or three issues that quietly cost them customers.

I'm offering free website audits this month for KC businesses. I'll take a look at your site and your Google listing and send you a short, honest summary of what's working and what isn't. No sales pitch. Just information you can use.

If you'd like one, just reply to this email or book a quick call here: [Calendly link]

Either way, I hope business is going well.

Best,

Either way, hope things are going well with the business.

— Jacob

---

Hey [Name] — really glad we got [project] across the finish line. Hope it's already bringing in some results for you.

Quick ask: if you know anyone else in the KC area who could use help with a website, Google Business setup, or any of the AI stuff we talked about — I'd love an introduction.

A referral from a happy client is the best way I can grow, and I'll always take good care of anyone you send my way.

Even just a mention if the topic comes up would mean a lot. Thanks again for trusting me with the project.

— Jacob

---

### Template 10 — Free Website Audit Offer Post (Any Platform)

Is your business website actually working for you — or just existing?

I'm offering free website audits for Kansas City area businesses this month. Here's what I'll look at:

- Mobile display (does it look right on a phone?)
- Load speed (slow sites lose visitors)
- Google visibility (are you showing up in searches?)
- Contact clarity (can people figure out how to reach you?)
- Trust signals (do you look credible to a new visitor?)

I'll send you a short written summary within 24 hours. No call required, no pitch at the end. Just honest feedback you can actually use.

To get one: comment below with your website URL, or DM me directly.

If you don't have a website, I can audit your Google Business Profile or Facebook page instead.

# SECTION 5: CLIENT CONTRACT

---

## Freelance Services Agreement

**Jacob Cascone — Web & AI Services**

---

This agreement is between **Jacob Cascone** ("Developer") and **[Client Name / Business Name]** ("Client"). It covers the work we've agreed to do together. It's written in plain English because contracts shouldn't require a lawyer to understand.

---

### 1. Project Scope

The work covered by this agreement is: **[describe project here — e.g., "A new 5-page business website including Home, About, Services, Contact, and a Blog page."]**

Any work outside of that description is considered out of scope and may require a separate quote. If scope needs to change, we'll agree on it in writing (email is fine) before I start the extra work.

---

### 2. Payment Terms

- **50% due upfront** before work begins. I won't start until this is received.
- **50% due on delivery** — when I deliver the final files, site access, or completed setup.
- Accepted payment methods: [Stripe link / Zelle / Venmo / etc.]
- If final payment isn't received within 7 days of delivery, I reserve the right to pause or remove access to the delivered work until payment clears.

---

### 3. Revisions

Two rounds of revisions are included in the project price.

A "round of revisions" means one consolidated list of changes — not back-and-forth messages over several days. Please collect all your feedback at once before submitting.

Additional revision rounds beyond the two included are billed at $75/hour.

---

### 4. Timeline

I'll provide an estimated delivery date at project kickoff. Timelines depend on how quickly you provide feedback, content, and approvals.

If I'm ever going to miss a deadline, I'll tell you in advance. I ask the same courtesy from you — delays on your end (like late content or feedback) may push the delivery date back accordingly.

---

### 5. If the Client Goes Silent

If I don't hear from you for 14 consecutive days during an active project, I'll send one final check-in. If there's still no response after 7 more days (21 days total), I may consider the project paused.

The upfront deposit is non-refundable in this case, since time and work has already been invested. If you want to resume later, we can discuss whether additional fees apply.

---

### 6. Who Owns the Work

You do. Once final payment is received, you own the finished product — the website, the copy, the design, all of it. I may photograph or screenshot the work to include in my portfolio unless you ask me not to.

Third-party tools (like chatbot platforms, email services, or hosting providers) are governed by their own terms of service.

---

### 7. No Guarantee of Business Results

I build good websites and set up useful tools. I can't guarantee specific outcomes like a certain number of customers, calls, leads, or revenue. Those results depend on many factors outside my control — your market, your pricing, your reputation, your follow-through.

What I can guarantee: I'll do quality work, communicate clearly, and deliver what I said I would.

---

### 8. General

This agreement is the full understanding between us. Any changes need to be agreed on in writing. This agreement is governed by the laws of the state of Missouri.

7. After you've been active as a neighbor for a few weeks, you can explore Nextdoor's "Local Business" section to create a business profile separately

**Note:** Nextdoor limits how often you can post in non-local areas. Focus on your immediate neighborhood first, then expand.

### 5. Stripe Account Setup

**Cost:** Free to set up. Stripe takes 2.9% + 30¢ per transaction (no monthly fee)
**Time to complete:** 20–30 minutes
**First action:** Go to stripe.com and click "Start now"

**Steps:**

1. Go to stripe.com → create an account with your email
2. Enter your legal name: **Jacob Cascone**
3. Business type: **Individual / Sole Proprietor**
4. Business description: "Freelance web development and technology consulting services"
5. Enter your SSN (last 4 for starters, full SSN may be needed for payouts)
6. Add your bank account for payouts (routing + account number)
7. Once your account is active, go to **Products** → **Payment Links** → create a payment link for each service:
   - "Website Deposit — $X" (set to 50% of your common project total)
   - "Google Business Profile Setup — $150"
   - "Website Refresh — $275" (midpoint)
   - "AI Chatbot Deposit — $350"
8. Copy each payment link and save them — you'll paste these into invoices and DMs

**Tip:** You can also send payment links directly in text/DM conversations. Much easier than asking people to fill out a form.

### 6. Wave Invoicing Setup

**Cost:** Free (Wave is free for invoicing and accounting)
**Time to complete:** 20 minutes
**First action:** Go to waveapps.com and create a free account

**Steps:**

1. Go to waveapps.com → Sign up free
2. Business name: **Jacob Cascone Web & AI Solutions**
3. Business type: **Freelancer / Self-employed**
4. Go to **Settings → Business Profile** and fill in:
   - Your name and business name
   - Kansas City, MO address (or just city/state if you prefer)
   - Your email and phone
5. Upload your logo if you have one (even just your name in a clean font from Canva works)
6. Go to **Invoices → Products & Services** and add each of your services with default prices
7. Create your first invoice — fill in a real or sample client — and see how it looks
8. Set up default **payment terms**: Net 7 (payment due within 7 days)
9. Add a **thank you note** to all invoices:
   > "Thank you for your business. I appreciate you trusting me with this project. Please reach out with any questions."
10. Wave also does bookkeeping — connect your bank account or just use it for invoices only. Either works.

**Note:** Wave charges for credit card processing (similar to Stripe). You can use Stripe for actual payments and Wave just for invoice recordkeeping if you prefer.

### 7. Calendly Free Tier Setup

**Cost:** Free (free tier allows 1 event type — enough to start)
**Time to complete:** 15 minutes
**First action:** Go to calendly.com and sign up free

**Steps:**

1. Go to calendly.com → "Sign up free" with your email
2. Your Calendly URL will be: calendly.com/jacobcascone (or similar — customize it)
3. Create one event type: **"Free 20-Minute Intro Call"**
4. Duration: 20 minutes
5. Location: **Zoom link** (or Google Meet — Calendly can auto-generate a meeting link if you connect your calendar)
6. Description to show on the booking page:
   > "A quick, no-pressure call to talk about your business and whether I can help. Come with questions — I'll come with ideas."
7. Set your availability: choose the days and times you actually want calls (be realistic — don't open 7am–9pm)
8. Buffer time: add 10 minutes before and after each meeting so you're not back-to-back
9. Connect your Google Calendar so Calendly checks for conflicts automatically
10. Copy your booking link: **calendly.com/jacobcascone/intro** — this is what you'll share everywhere

**Upgrade note:** The free tier limits you to one event type. That's fine for now. If you want to add a "60-minute paid consultation" or "project kickoff call" type later, you'd need the $10/month plan.

### 8. Tally.so Intake Form Setup

**Cost:** Free (Tally free plan covers unlimited forms and submissions)
**Time to complete:** 20–30 minutes
**First action:** Go to tally.so and create a free account

**Steps:**

1. Go to tally.so → Sign up free
2. Click "New form" → start from scratch (or use a blank template)
3. Title the form: **"Tell Me About Your Business"**
4. Add an intro block with this text:
   > "Thanks for reaching out! Fill this out before our call — it helps me come prepared with real ideas for your situation. Takes about 3 minutes."
5. Add each of the 10 questions from Section 6 of this document in order:
   - Questions 1, 2, 3: Short answer fields
   - Question 4: Checkbox group
   - Questions 5, 6: Long answer fields
   - Question 7: Checkbox group
   - Questions 8, 9: Multiple choice
   - Question 10: Long answer, marked optional
6. At the end, add a **Thank You page** with this message:
   > "Got it — I'll review this before our call. If you haven't booked a time yet, grab a spot here: [your Calendly link]"
   Add a button: "Book Your Call" → link to your Calendly
7. Go to **Settings → Form URL** and customize it: tally.so/r/[yourcustomslug]
8. Copy the form link — you'll share this whenever someone expresses interest
9. Optional: In Tally settings, set up email notifications so you get an email every time someone submits the form

**How to use it:** When someone DMs you on any platform and says they're interested, reply with your Calendly link AND your Tally form link. Ask them to fill out the form before the call. This filters serious inquirers from tire-kickers and makes your calls 10x more productive.
