You might think your business doesn't need a website. You've got word of mouth, maybe a Facebook page, and business is fine. I hear this a lot from small business owners in KC, and I get it — if something's working, why change it?

But here's the thing: **you're leaving money on the table.**

## People Google everything now

When someone's toilet breaks at 2am, they don't dig through a phone book. They Google "plumber near me." When someone wants a haircut in Mission, they search "barber Mission KS." If you don't have a website, you don't show up. Period.

Even if someone hears about you through a friend, the first thing they do is look you up online. No website? That feels sketchy to most people in 2026. They'll go with the competitor who has one.

## A Facebook page isn't a website

I hear this one a lot: "I have a Facebook page, isn't that enough?" No. Here's why:

- **You don't own it.** Facebook can change their algorithm, limit your reach, or shut down your page tomorrow. Your website is yours.
- **It looks unprofessional.** A Facebook page says "I haven't invested in my business." A clean website says "I'm legit."
- **You can't rank on Google with a Facebook page.** Not effectively, anyway.
- **You can't control the experience.** On your site, you decide exactly what people see and how they contact you.

## It doesn't have to be expensive

This is the big misconception. People hear "website" and think $5,000-$10,000 from some agency. That's not the reality for most small businesses.

A clean, fast, mobile-friendly site with a few pages and a contact form? That can be done for a few hundred dollars. I build them starting at $350. You don't need animations, videos, and a blog with 50 posts. You need:

- Your name and what you do
- How to contact you
- Where you're located
- Maybe some photos of your work

That's it. Simple, clean, and effective.

## It works for you 24/7

Your website doesn't take breaks. It doesn't call in sick. It's there at midnight when someone is Googling your type of business. It's there on weekends. It's there on holidays. It's the most reliable employee you'll ever have.

## What to do next

If you don't have a website, or if yours looks like it was built in 2010, it's time. You don't need to overthink it. Start simple, get something cleaned up, and you can always build on it later.

I offer free audits for small businesses — no pitch, no pressure. Just an honest look at where you stand online and what would help.

      "The honest answer to the most common question I get. Spoiler: it's probably less than you think.",

This is the #1 question I get from small business owners: "How much is a website going to cost me?" And honestly, it's a fair question — the range online is insane. You'll see everything from $50 Wix templates to $50,000 agency quotes.

Here's the real answer for a small business.

## The agency problem

Big agencies charge $3,000-$15,000+ for a small business website. Why? Because they have account managers, project managers, designers, developers, QA testers, and an office in a nice part of town. You're paying for all of that overhead — not just the website.

The actual work of building a 5-page small business site? That's not $10,000 worth of work. Not even close.

## The DIY trap

On the other end, you've got Wix, Squarespace, and WordPress.com. They look cheap upfront — $15/month, build it yourself! But here's what they don't tell you:

- **You'll spend 40+ hours fighting the builder.** Your time has value.
- **It'll look like a template** because it is one. Your competitors probably picked the same one.
- **You'll need plugins for basic stuff** and those have monthly fees that add up.
- **It'll be slow.** Page builders add bloat. Google notices, and so do your customers.
- **You won't know SEO.** So you'll build something that looks okay but doesn't rank.

## What a website should actually cost

For a typical small business — a plumber, a barber, a bakery, a landscaper, a tutor — here's what you actually need:

**$350-600 gets you:**
- 3-5 pages (home, about, services, contact, maybe a gallery)
- Mobile-friendly design that looks good on phones
- Contact form that actually works
- Basic SEO so Google can find you
- Fast loading speed
- You own everything when it's done

That's it. That's a real, professional website that will serve you well.

## When it costs more

Some businesses need more, and that's fine:

- **E-commerce** (selling products online) — more complex, more pages, payment integration
- **Booking systems** — appointment scheduling, calendar integration
- **Custom features** — AI chatbots, client portals, member areas
- **Ongoing content** — regular blog posts, SEO campaigns

These push the price up, but a basic business website? A few hundred dollars from someone who knows what they're doing.

## What to watch out for

Red flags when someone quotes you for a website:

- **Monthly payments that never end.** Some companies charge $200/month forever. After 2 years you've paid $4,800 and you still don't own it.
- **Long contracts.** You shouldn't need to commit to 12 months for a website.
- **Vague pricing.** If they can't give you a number, that's a problem.
- **Upselling everything.** "You need social media management, SEO retainer, content creation, brand strategy..." Maybe. But probably not right now.

## My approach

I give you one clear price upfront. 50% before, 50% when it's done. You own everything. No monthly lock-in, no surprise fees. If you want ongoing help after, I offer a retainer — but it's optional, not required.

Simple as that.

Having a website is better than not having one. But having a *bad* website? That can actually be worse than nothing. A bad site tells people "this business doesn't care about quality" — and they'll take their money elsewhere.

Here are 5 signs your website is costing you customers.

## 1. It's not mobile-friendly

Pull out your phone right now and look at your website. Does it look good? Can you read the text without zooming in? Can you tap the buttons without accidentally hitting the wrong one?

Over 60% of web traffic is on phones now. If your site doesn't work on mobile, you're turning away the majority of your visitors. Google also ranks mobile-friendly sites higher, so you're hurting your search visibility too.

## 2. It takes forever to load

If your site takes more than 3 seconds to load, about half your visitors will leave before they see anything. They'll hit the back button and click on your competitor instead.

Common culprits: huge uncompressed images, too many plugins, cheap hosting, bloated page builders. A fast site loads in under 2 seconds.

## 3. There's no clear way to contact you

I see this constantly. Someone lands on a small business website and... there's no phone number. No contact form. Maybe there's an email buried in the footer in tiny text.

Your contact info should be obvious. Phone number in the header. Contact form on its own page. An email that's easy to find. Make it dead simple for people to reach you.

## 4. It looks like it was built 10 years ago

Web design trends change. If your site has:

- Tiny text on a white background
- Stock photos that look like they're from 2012
- A layout that feels "boxy" and cluttered
- Flash animations (yes, some sites still have these)
- A "last updated" date from years ago

...people will assume your business is outdated too. First impressions matter, and your website is often the first impression.

## 5. It doesn't tell people what you do

This sounds obvious, but you'd be surprised. I've seen business websites where I couldn't figure out what they actually do within the first 5 seconds.

When someone lands on your site, they should immediately see:
- **What you do** (plumbing, tutoring, landscaping, etc.)
- **Where you do it** (Kansas City, Mission, KC metro, etc.)
- **How to get started** (call, fill out a form, book online)

If your site doesn't answer those three questions instantly, people will leave.

## The fix

The good news: most of these problems are fixable without rebuilding from scratch. A website refresh — cleaning up the design, speeding it up, making it mobile-friendly, and fixing the content — can usually be done for $100-250.

Sometimes a full rebuild makes more sense, but don't assume you need to start over. Often the bones are fine and it just needs some work.

You've probably seen chatbots on websites — those little chat bubbles in the corner that pop up and ask if you need help. Most of them are terrible. They follow a script, they can't actually answer your question, and they feel like talking to a brick wall.

AI chatbots are different. And they're getting good enough that they actually make sense for small businesses now.

## What an AI chatbot actually does

An AI chatbot uses artificial intelligence (think ChatGPT-level technology) to have real conversations with your website visitors. It's not following a script with pre-written responses. It actually understands what people are asking and gives useful answers.

Here's what that looks like in practice:

- A customer asks "What are your hours on Saturday?" and the bot answers correctly
- Someone asks "Do you do kitchen remodels?" and the bot explains your services
- A lead asks "How much does a basic service cost?" and the bot gives a helpful range
- Someone asks a question at 11pm on a Sunday — and actually gets an answer

## How it helps your business

**It captures leads while you sleep.** Someone visits your site at midnight, has a question, and instead of leaving they chat with your bot. The bot answers their question and collects their contact info. You wake up to a new lead in your inbox.

**It answers the same questions so you don't have to.** Every business has those 10-15 questions they get asked constantly. The chatbot handles all of them automatically.

**It makes you look professional.** Having an AI chatbot on your site signals that you're a modern, tech-savvy business. That matters to a lot of customers.

**It qualifies leads.** The bot can ask visitors what they need, what their budget is, and when they're looking to start — so by the time they reach you, you already know if they're a good fit.

## Does your business need one?

An AI chatbot makes sense if:

- **You get website visitors but not enough inquiries.** The chatbot lowers the barrier to reaching out.
- **You're missing calls or emails.** Maybe you're on a job site all day and can't answer the phone. The bot covers for you.
- **You answer the same questions repeatedly.** Automate those answers and save yourself time.
- **You want to stand out.** Most of your local competitors don't have one. It's a differentiator.

It probably doesn't make sense if:

- **You don't have a website yet.** Get the website first.
- **Your business runs entirely on referrals and you're fully booked.** If you don't need more leads, you don't need a chatbot.

## What it costs

I build AI chatbots for small businesses for $250-500. That includes training the bot on your specific business, setting it up on your website, and making sure it gives accurate, helpful answers about your services.

There's usually a small monthly cost for the AI service (think $20-50/month depending on usage), but the leads it captures typically pay for that many times over.

## It's not as complicated as it sounds

The whole point of working with someone like me is that you don't need to understand the technology. I handle the setup, the training, the integration — all of it. You just get more leads and fewer repetitive questions.

If there's one thing I could tell every small business owner to do today, it would be this: **set up your Google Business Profile.** It's free, it takes 30 minutes, and it's probably the single most important thing you can do for your online visibility.

## What is it?

Google Business Profile (GBP) is that box that shows up on the right side of Google when you search for a business, or those listings that appear on Google Maps. It shows your name, address, phone number, hours, reviews, photos, and a link to your website.

When someone searches "plumber near me" or "coffee shop Mission KS," the first thing they see isn't website results — it's the Google Maps pack with 3 local businesses. That's powered by Google Business Profiles.

## Why it matters so much

**It's where most local searches end.** Studies show that nearly half of all Google searches have local intent. And most people pick a business from the Maps results without ever scrolling down to the website listings.

**Reviews live here.** Your Google reviews are the most powerful social proof you have. When someone sees you have 47 five-star reviews, that's more convincing than anything on your website.

**It's free traffic.** You don't pay for clicks from your Google Business Profile. It's free visibility to people actively searching for what you offer.

## How to set it up right

### 1. Claim your listing

Go to business.google.com and either claim your existing listing or create a new one. Google will verify you own the business (usually by sending a postcard with a code to your address).

### 2. Fill out everything

Don't skip fields. Fill out:

- **Business name** — exactly as it appears in real life
- **Category** — pick the most specific one (e.g., "Residential Plumber" not just "Plumber")
- **Address and service area** — be specific
- **Phone number** — one you actually answer
- **Hours** — keep these updated, especially holidays
- **Website URL** — if you have one
- **Business description** — what you do, who you serve, where you operate

### 3. Add photos

Businesses with photos get 42% more requests for directions and 35% more clicks to their website. Add:

- Your storefront or work vehicle
- Your team (or just you)
- Your work (completed projects, products, etc.)
- Interior shots if applicable

Real photos, not stock images. People can tell the difference.

### 4. Get reviews

This is the big one. Ask every happy customer to leave a Google review. Make it easy:

- Send them a direct link to your review page
- Ask right after you've done good work (timing matters)
- Don't be weird about it — a simple "If you're happy with the work, a Google review would really help me out" goes a long way

### 5. Post updates

Google Business Profile has a "posts" feature. Use it. Share updates, offers, photos of recent work. It shows Google you're active and gives searchers more reasons to choose you.

## Common mistakes

- **Wrong hours.** Nothing loses trust faster than showing up to a closed business when Google said they were open.
- **Not responding to reviews.** Respond to every review — good and bad. It shows you care.
- **Ignoring questions.** People can ask questions on your profile. Answer them quickly.
- **Duplicate listings.** If you have multiple listings for the same business, clean that up. It confuses Google.

## I can do this for you

If this all sounds like a hassle, I offer Google Business Profile setup and optimization for $75. I'll claim your listing, optimize every field, write your business description, and show you how to collect reviews. Takes the whole thing off your plate.

I'm not an agency. I'm one person — Jacob. I do the consulting, the design, the development, and the deployment. When you email me, I'm the one who reads it. When you have a question about your site, I'm the one who answers it.

And honestly? For most small businesses, that's a better deal.

## The agency experience

Here's what typically happens when a small business hires an agency:

1. You talk to a **sales person** who promises you the world
2. You get handed off to an **account manager** who translates your needs
3. The account manager talks to a **project manager** who plans the work
4. The project manager assigns it to a **designer** who makes mockups
5. The mockups go to a **developer** who builds the site
6. The developer's work goes to **QA** for testing
7. Questions and revisions go back through this entire chain

You're playing telephone with your own project. Every person in that chain adds time, cost, and the chance of miscommunication.

And you're paying for all of them. The person actually building your site might take 15 hours. But you're billed for 60 hours because everyone else needs their cut.

## How I work

You talk to me. I listen to what you need. I build it. We go back and forth until you're happy. Done.

No telephone game. No layers. No bloated timelines. If you want to change something, you text me and it's done that day — not "I'll submit a change request to the project manager who will schedule it with the development team for next sprint."

## Why this is better for small businesses

**It's faster.** No handoffs, no waiting for approvals, no "let me check with the team." I can usually deliver a full website in 1-2 weeks.

**It's cheaper.** I don't have an office, a sales team, or a middle management layer. My overhead is basically a laptop and some coffee. That means lower prices for you.

**Communication is direct.** You have a question? You ask me. You get an answer from the person who actually built the thing. Not a filtered version through someone who has never looked at your code.

**I actually care.** This isn't a project number in some agency's pipeline. Your business and your website reflect on me directly. I have every incentive to make it great.

## When you should hire an agency

I'll be honest — agencies have their place. If you're a mid-size company that needs:

- A team of 5+ working simultaneously
- Enterprise-level software with complex integrations
- A 50-page website with ongoing content production
- Dedicated design, development, and marketing departments

Then yeah, an agency might make sense. But if you're a small business that needs a clean website, some AI tools, or help showing up on Google? You don't need all that. You need someone who will sit down, listen, and build what you actually need.

That's what I do.

      "How automated emails can save you hours every week and make sure no lead falls through the cracks.",

You know that feeling when you realize you forgot to follow up with a potential customer? They reached out two weeks ago, you got busy, and now they've probably gone with someone else.

Email automation fixes that. Once it's set up, it runs automatically — no more forgetting, no more missed opportunities.

## What email automation actually means

It's simpler than it sounds. Email automation means setting up emails that send themselves when something specific happens. For example:

- **Someone fills out your contact form** → They instantly get a confirmation email saying you'll be in touch within 24 hours
- **You finish a job** → The customer automatically gets a thank-you email with a link to leave a review
- **A lead goes cold** → They get a friendly follow-up email a week later checking in
- **Someone books an appointment** → They get a reminder email the day before

You set these up once and they run forever. No manual work, no forgetting, no hiring someone to send emails all day.

## Why it matters for small businesses

**Speed wins deals.** Studies show that responding to a lead within 5 minutes makes you 21 times more likely to close the deal compared to waiting 30 minutes. Automation gives you instant response time, even when you're on a job.

**Consistency builds trust.** When every customer gets a professional follow-up, a thank-you, and a check-in, it makes your business feel polished and reliable. Even if it's just you running the show.

**Reviews are the lifeblood of local business.** That automatic review request email after a job? It's the easiest way to build up your Google reviews without awkwardly asking every customer in person.

**No leads fall through the cracks.** Every inquiry gets a response. Every lead gets followed up on. Every customer gets thanked. Automatically.

## What it looks like in practice

Here's a simple automation I set up for a lot of small businesses:

**New Lead Flow:**
1. Customer fills out contact form on website
2. They instantly receive: "Thanks for reaching out! I got your message and will get back to you within 24 hours. — Jacob"
3. You get a notification with their details
4. If you haven't responded in 24 hours, you get a reminder
5. After the job is done, they get a review request email

That entire flow runs without you lifting a finger after the initial setup.

## Common automations that work great

- **Appointment reminders** — reduces no-shows by up to 30%
- **Review requests** — sent 1-2 days after service completion
- **Welcome emails** — for new customers or newsletter subscribers
- **Follow-up sequences** — for leads who didn't convert right away
- **Seasonal check-ins** — "Hey, it's been 6 months since we serviced your HVAC. Time for a tune-up?"

## It's not spammy

Let me be clear: this isn't about blasting people with marketing emails they didn't ask for. It's about sending the right message at the right time to people who already engaged with your business. That's not spam — that's good customer service.

## What it costs

I set up email automation for $200-350 depending on complexity. That includes the initial strategy, setting up the flows, writing the emails, and testing everything. The email platform itself usually runs $20-50/month depending on your list size.

The ROI is pretty straightforward: if one automation prevents one lost lead per month, it's already paid for itself.

SEO — Search Engine Optimization — is one of those terms that makes most business owners' eyes glaze over. And I don't blame you. The SEO industry is full of jargon, snake oil, and people charging $2,000/month for "optimization" that doesn't move the needle.

Here's what actually matters for a local small business.

## The basics (the stuff that actually works)

### 1. Google Business Profile

I wrote a whole post about this, but it bears repeating: your Google Business Profile is the most important thing for local SEO. If you do nothing else, do this. Claim it, fill it out completely, and get reviews.

### 2. Your website needs to say what you do and where

This sounds obvious but most small business websites fail at this. Google needs to see clear signals about:

- **What service you provide** — "residential plumbing" not just "services"
- **Where you provide it** — "Kansas City," "Mission KS," "Johnson County"
- **Who you are** — a real business with a real address

Put your city and service in your page titles, headings, and throughout your content. Not in a spammy way — just naturally. "Residential Plumbing in Kansas City" as a heading is both good for SEO and helpful for visitors.

### 3. Mobile-friendly and fast

Google has been using mobile-first indexing for years now. If your site isn't mobile-friendly, your rankings suffer. If it's slow, your rankings suffer. A fast, responsive site is table stakes for SEO in 2026.

### 4. Consistent name, address, and phone (NAP)

Your business name, address, and phone number need to be exactly the same everywhere — your website, Google Business Profile, Yelp, Facebook, Yellow Pages, everywhere. Inconsistencies confuse Google and hurt your rankings.

If your website says "Bob's Plumbing LLC" but your Google profile says "Bob's Plumbing" and Yelp says "Bobs Plumbing LLC" — that's a problem.

### 5. Reviews

Google factors reviews into local rankings. More reviews (and better reviews) = higher rankings. Respond to every review too — Google sees that as a positive signal.

## What doesn't matter (as much as people say)

### Blogging for SEO

"You need to blog every week for SEO!" No. For a local business, a blog is nice to have but it's not the main driver of your rankings. Your Google Business Profile, reviews, and on-page basics matter way more.

Don't let someone charge you hundreds per month for blog posts when your Google Business Profile isn't even optimized.

### Meta keywords

Some SEO people still talk about "meta keywords." Google has literally said they ignore the meta keywords tag. It hasn't mattered for over a decade.

### Backlink schemes

"We'll get you 500 backlinks for $200!" These are spam links that will hurt you, not help you. Quality backlinks matter, but you can't buy them for $200 on Fiverr.

### Complex technical SEO

Unless your site has serious technical issues (broken pages, duplicate content, can't be crawled), you don't need an expensive technical SEO audit. The basics — fast loading, mobile-friendly, clear structure — cover 90% of what matters for a small business.

## The honest truth about SEO

For most local businesses, SEO isn't some magical, complex thing. It comes down to:

1. **Google Business Profile** — optimized and active
2. **A decent website** — mobile-friendly, fast, says what you do and where
3. **Reviews** — consistently getting new ones
4. **Consistency** — same info everywhere online

Do those four things and you'll outrank most of your local competitors, because most of them aren't doing even that.

## What I include

Every website I build comes with SEO basics baked in — proper page titles, meta descriptions, heading structure, fast loading, mobile responsiveness, and local keywords. It's not an add-on or an upsell. It's just how I build sites.

If you want more dedicated SEO work, we can talk about that. But for most small businesses, the basics done well are more than enough to get results.
